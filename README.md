# Output inspector

This is a lightweight tool to inspect the results of different image description
systems on the MS COCO validation set. It automatically downloads the images as
you browse through the results. This saves you from having to download *all* the
images in the dataset. I've also provided a script to download the images, if you
need to work offline.

## Requirements

* Python 3.6
* Flask 0.12

Other versions may work, but remain untested. The easiest way to get everything
to run is to install Anaconda. Download it from [this page](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).

## Sources

The data comes from the different systems that we analyzed in our COLING paper.

* BibTeX for all these systems can be found in the `Data/Systems/` folder.
* BibTeX for our COLING-paper is as follows:

```
@InProceedings{C18-1147,
  author = 	"van Miltenburg, Emiel
		and Elliott, Desmond
		and Vossen, Piek",
  title = 	"Measuring the Diversity of Automatic Image Descriptions",
  booktitle = 	"Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Computational Linguistics",
  year = 	"2018",
  publisher = 	"Association for Computational Linguistics",
  pages = 	"1730--1741",
  location = 	"Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA",
  url = 	"http://aclweb.org/anthology/C18-1147"
}
```

## Screenshot
Here's a preview of the tool. There's a simple navigation menu (previous, next),
with the image below, followed by the human-generated descriptions and the descriptions
generated by nine systems.

## How to run this tool

To run the tool, just use `python resultsviewer.py` from the main directory on the command line.
If you want to download the images first, run `python download_images.py` and wait for the script to complete. This may take a long time.

## For those new to the command line

Navigate to the main folder of this repository, and issue one of the commands from the previous section.
